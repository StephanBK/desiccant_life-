Cavity thermal model for the INOVUES vented SWR cavity.

WHAT THIS MODULE ANSWERS
------------------------
The condensation app knows one number: the temperature of the COLD surface
(inner face of the existing exterior pane). The moisture balance in Chunk 3
needs three more:

  1. T_warm  - the cavity-facing surface of the new interior IGU
  2. T_air   - the temperature of the air IN the cavity, which sets both the
               cavity's dry-air mass and its relative humidity
  3. m_cav   - kg of DRY air in the cavity, per square metre of glazing

DESIGN RULE
-----------
SI throughout. See engine/psychro.py.

    PREFER A MEASURED VALUE. WINDOW reports every surface temperature in the
    stack (ANLY-002 S3.1), so Arnold can read T_warm directly and you should
    pass it via ``f_from_t`` instead. This function exists for screening when
    that number is not to hand.

    DERIVATION
    ----------
    Treat the assembly as a series resistance chain from outdoor to indoor.
    In a series chain the temperature drop across each element is proportional
    to its resistance, so the f-value at any node is just the fraction of
    total resistance accumulated up to that node:

        f_node = R_outboard_of_node / R_total

    The cold surface and the warm surface are separated by exactly one
    element - the cavity itself. So:

        f_warm = (R_outboard + R_cav) / R_total
               = f_cold + R_cav / R_total
               = f_cold + R_cav . U_assembly          since U = 1/R_total

    Every term is a number INOVUES already has: f_cold from WINDOW, U from the
    assembly spec sheet, R_cav from the gap width.

    WORKED EXAMPLE - 277 Park SWR-VIG
        f_cold = 0.013, R_cav = 0.17 m2K/W, U = 0.70 W/m2K
        f_warm = 0.013 + 0.17 x 0.70 = 0.132
        T_warm = -18 + 39 x 0.132 = -12.8 degC

    Note how little the cavity warms even though the VIG behind it is highly
    insulating - the VIG strands everything outboard of it near outdoor
    temperature (ANLY-002 S2.2).

    STEADY-STATE ENERGY BALANCE
    ---------------------------
    Three ways heat reaches the cavity air, summing to zero at steady state:

        h_warm.A.(T_warm - T_air)          from the interior IGU surface
      + h_cold.A.(T_cold - T_air)          from the existing pane surface
      + m_dot.cp.(T_room - T_air)          carried in by vented room air
      = 0

    Rearranged, it is a weighted average of the three driving temperatures,
    each weighted by its conductance to the air:

        T_air = (h_w.T_warm + h_c.T_cold + m_dot.cp.T_room)
                / (h_w + h_c + m_dot.cp)

    With ``ach = 0`` this collapses exactly to the film-weighted mean of the
    two bounding surfaces that ANLY-002 S5.3 proposes.

    IS THE VENT TERM WORTH CARRYING?
    --------------------------------
    Barely, and that is a useful result rather than a wasted term. At
    ACH = 5, gap = 15.3 mm:

        m_dot = 5 x 0.0153 x 1.3 / 3600 = 2.8e-5 kg/s
        m_dot.cp = 2.8e-5 x 1006        = 0.028 W/K
        h_w + h_c                        = 6.0   W/K

    The vent contributes under half a percent of the conductance. Air is a
    poor carrier of heat but the ONLY carrier of moisture, which is precisely
    why ventilation dominates the moisture balance while being negligible
    here. Carrying the term costs nothing and lets us prove that claim in a
    test rather than assert it.

    """Warming of the COLD surface caused by vented room air, K. Returns >= 0
    whenever the room is warmer than the pane, <= 0 otherwise.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    ``t_from_f`` fixes the pane temperature from outdoor and room air alone,
    so the pane is identical at 0 ACH and 100 ACH. That is the one place the
    ANLY-002 companion note ("motion never reduces condensation") overreaches:
    the mass-transfer coefficient never falls with air speed, but the DRIVING
    FORCE (W_air - W_sat(T_surface)) does move, because room air arriving in
    the cavity also carries heat to the glass. This function closes that
    loop. NRC Canadian Building Digest 4 (Wilson, 1960) documents the effect
    on room-side glass; here it is applied to the cavity-side face.

    DERIVATION
    ----------
    The f-value already encodes a two-conductance network. In a series chain
    f_cold = R_outboard . U, so the pane's conductance to outdoors and to the
    room are

        G_out = U / f_cold              G_in = U / (1 - f_cold)

    and t_from_f is exactly their weighted mean. Venting adds a third path in
    parallel with G_in: room air enters at m_dot (carrying m_dot.cp W/K) and
    hands its heat to the pane through the cavity film h_cold. Two
    conductances in series:

        G_vent = 1 / (1/(m_dot.cp) + 1/h_cold)

    Adding a conductance to the room to a node already in balance moves it by

        dT = G_vent . (T_room - T_cold) / (G_out + G_in + G_vent)

    which is what is returned. Applied after solar and sky terms, so those
    still act on the unvented pane and this term reads the result.

    APPROXIMATION. The vent air warms the whole cavity air node, part of which
    flows on to the warm surface and straight back to the room. Routing all of
    it through h_cold to the cold pane is therefore an UPPER bound on the
    warming, i.e. the most favourable case for room-side venting. Since the
    result below is small even as an upper bound, the bound is the useful
    direction.

    WORKED EXAMPLE - 277 Park style stack, f_cold 0.30, U 1.7 W/m2K
        T_out -5 degC, T_room 21 degC  ->  T_cold = -5 + 0.30 x 26 = 2.8 degC
        G_out = 1.7/0.30 = 5.67   G_in = 1.7/0.70 = 2.43  W/m2K
        ACH 20, gap 15.3 mm: m_dot = 20 x 0.0153 x 1.29 / 3600 = 1.10e-4 kg/s
        m_dot.cp = 0.110 W/K ; series with h_cold 3.0 -> G_vent = 0.106
        dT = 0.106 x (21 - 2.8) / (5.67 + 2.43 + 0.106) = 0.24 K
        ACH 100: G_vent = 0.46, dT = 0.97 K

    Room dew point at 70 degF / 35 % RH is 5.4 degC. A pane at 2.8 degC needs
    2.6 K to clear it; passive venting supplies a quarter of that at 20 ACH
    and under one degree at the free-exchange limit. The warming mechanism is
    real and it is an order of magnitude short on a cold day. It only flips
    hours that were already within about 1 K of the dew point.

    Glass emits long-wave to a sky that is colder than the air, and that heat
    is replaced by convection from the air, so the surface settles BELOW air
    temperature. This is why cars frost on clear nights when the air never
    reaches freezing.

    The half of the view occupied by ground is treated as being at air
    temperature, so it exchanges no net radiation. A warm masonry facade
    opposite would reduce this; a plaza would not.

    Runs day and night. It is largest at night only because solar gain is
    absent then, not because the mechanism switches off.
